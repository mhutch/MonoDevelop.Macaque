# Code snippets

Code snippets are small pieces of code that you can insert to help you write code
faster. You can activate snippets with the
[MonoDevelop.Ide.Commands.TextEditorCommands.ShowCodeTemplateWindow](#command) and
typing the name of the snippet, then pressing [Enter](#key).

Many common snippets have short names, which show up in the IntelliSense
completion list. After committing the item from completion, press [Tab](#key) to
expand the snippet. It may seem like you are pressing [Tab](#key) twice,
but the second press of the tab key is needed to prevent accidental activation.

There are many snippets with the same names as language keywords. For example, the
C# `for` snippet creates a for loop.

Snippets may be added and edited in [TextEditor/CodeTemplates](#prefs).
