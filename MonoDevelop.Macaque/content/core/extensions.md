# Extensions

There are plenty of great extensions that make your coding experience more
pleasant and productive. They add functionality like templates
for Prism projects and files, IntelliSense for MSBuild project files,
commands to help you manage secrets in your ASP.NET Core projects, the
ability to live preview your Xamarin.Forms XAML and CSS files on multiple
devices at once, and much more.

You can install extensions from the _Gallery_ tab in the _Extension Manager_, which
you can open using the [MonoDevelop.Ide.Commands.ToolCommands.AddinManager](#command) command.

Make sure to check back often, as new extensions are being created all the time.
You can even [create your own](https://aka.ms/vs/mac/extend)!
