# Maximize the document

When you really want to focus on your code or design, you can maximize your editing space by double-clicking on the
document tab to auto-hide all the pads at once. Double-click again to switch back, or use the
[MonoDevelop.Ide.Commands.FileTabCommands.ToggleMaximize](#command) command.
